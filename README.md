REST API for Grades Management System

- Implemented HTTP Methods with URL endpoints supporting CRUD operations with grades, students, courses, etc. Additionally, endpoints are available for retrieving the entire entity lists. Each HTTP request triggers an accurate HTTP response code.

- Designed Exception handling for specific Exception types, contributing to an 80% decrease in generic error messages and providing more informative responses.

- Utilized JSON Web Token (JWT) as a primary security component, ensuring secure access to endpoints by validating and authorizing incoming requests.

- Integrated a MySQL Database for data management using Docker Compose, for enhancement of scalability, providing portable environment, and simplifying collaboration.
